🛠️ Project Setup
I started by setting up the React project using Vite for fast development.

🎨 Styling
For CSS styling, I used Tailwind CSS:

🔀 Routing
For page navigation, I implemented React Router DOM:

🔐 Authentication
For Login and Signup, I used the Axios library to make API calls and handle user authentication:
👉 https://axios-http.com/docs/intro
All API responses are handled properly with loading and error states.
