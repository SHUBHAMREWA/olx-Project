🛠️ Project Setup
I started by setting up the React project using Vite for fast development.

🎨 Styling
For CSS styling, I used Tailwind CSS:

🔀 Routing
For page navigation, I implemented React Router DOM:

🔐 Authentication
For Login and Signup, I used the Axios library to make API calls and handle user authentication:
👉 https://axios-http.com/docs/intro
All API responses are handled properly with loading and error states.

✅ Implemented **Product Search** functionality using React.js  
✅ Handled **input keyword via child component state lifting**  
✅ Filtered product list using `Array.filter()` based on:
   - product name  
   - description  
   - category  
✅ Used `.toLowerCase()` + `.includes()` to make search case-insensitive  
✅ Stored filtered array in state and dynamically rendered search results  

🛠️ Technologies: React.js | State Lifting | Controlled Input | Array.filter()
